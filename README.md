## CS50 Capstone: Bug Tracker

**Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.**
My final capstone project is a bug tracker.
It lets users track their bugs on team projects.

Bugs have the following details
* Titles
* Descriptions (Reproduction steps)
* Estimates (in hours)
* Subject Matter Expert (who is responsible for solvint the bug)
  * They can be one of several types/categories:
  * Functional
  * Performance	
  * Usability
  * Compatability
  * Security
  * Other
* They can also have one of several severities:
  * Low
  * Medium
  * High
  * Critical
* Users can create and edit bugs,
They can also mark bugs complete.

**Whatâ€™s contained in each file you created.**
Here are a following list of files by directories
* /bugtracker/
This contains all the python files used by the server.
	* admin.py
	This file is responsible for registering the models: User, bug, organization.
	* apps.py
	This file registers the following app: "bugtracker".
	* forms.py
	This file generates the form to create bugs, based off of the model for the "bug" object.
	* models.py
	This file holds a list of models for objects that are used by this application. Currently, there are 3 models:
		* 'organization': The organization object represents an organization that the user is part of. This  could be a company or just a group made for a group project. When a user logs in, they will see all bugs that are in that group; there is also a separate page for bugs that are assigned to them specifically.
		* 'User': The user object represents a user that has logged in, they have the ability to create, edit, and close bugs.
		* 'bug': "A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways". This application allows groups to track bugs in any software that they are building.
	* tests.py
	This file was generate automatically when the app was created, but is not used.
	* urls.py
	This file contains all the different urls that are accessible by the user. Some of them are direct urls that lead to a webpage, however some of them are APIs that return a JSON object which are fed into Javascript on these webpages. 
	* views.py
	This file contains all the routes. Each url from the urls.py file calls a method from this file, which returns either a JSON (in the case of an api call)  or renders an html page.
* /bugtracker/static/bugtracker
This contains all the Javascript files used in this project
	* bugdetailspage.js
	This file is run on the html page 'bugdetailspage.html' and is responsible for querying the server for the contents of a specific bug. The contents that are displayed include all attributes of the bug that are in the mode. In addition, the user can click a button that allows them to edit the bug.
	* bugeditpage.js
	This file is run on the html page 'bugeditpage.html' and is responsible for displaying the layout of the edit page.
	* buglist_react.js
	This file is run on the html page 'buglistpage.html' and is responsible for querying the server for the list of bugs that the belongs to the organization that the user is part of. It provides buttons for each bug that takes the user to the details page of that specific bug which lists more attributes about the bug. This page is written in react.
	* createbug.js
	This file is run on the page 'createbug.html' and provides a form for the user to interact with. The form allows for the creation of new bugs.
	* userbuglist_react.js
	This file is run on 'userbuglistpage.html' and is similar to 'buglist_react.js' except for listing all the bugs for that organization/project, it is only lists the bugs for which the user is the "Subject Matter Expert". Like 'buglist_react.js', it also is written using react.
	* vanilla_template.js
	This file was used only for debugging.
* /bugtracker/templates/bugtracker/
	* bugdegailspage.html
	* bugeditpage.html
	* buglistpage.html
	* createbug.html
	* error.html
	* index.html
