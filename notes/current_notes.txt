    /Need to create admin account (x1 at least)
    /Need to create layout.html page

    /Need to create group for model
    /Need to register all models (admin.site.register) so they show up in the admin console
        /For some reason this didn't work?   
    /Also git is broken
    /Need to extend user model to include group foreign key

    /21.01.29 - Left off on rendering bugs page
    /    Need to make a get request to the view that returns JSON with bug list

    /Need to list all current bugs on the index page (if logged in)
    /    Gonna need to come up with alternative

    20.02.06:

    /Need to add all information about the bug to bug list
    /    title
    /    severity
    /        colors?
    /    type
    /        colors?
    /    (then a small label at the bottom in light gray asking user to click for more details)
    Make details button clickable -> onclick it redirects to detailed page 
        All information present
        also edit button

    Need to make "create bug" page 
    Need to total bug list to homescreen
