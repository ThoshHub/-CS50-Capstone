    /Need to create group for model
    /Need to register all models (admin.site.register) so they show up in the admin console

    /21.01.29 - Left off on rendering bugs page
    /    Need to make a get request to the view that returns JSON with bug list
    /    Need for that to print out something to make sure that view is being hit
    /        From there you can change it so that 


    /Need to list all current bugs on the index page (if logged in)
    /    Gonna need to come up with alternative 
    /Need to replace front-end with react


    20.02.06:

    /Need to add all information about the bug to bug list
    /    title
    /    severity
    /        colors?
    /    type
    /        colors?
    /    (then a small label at the bottom in light gray asking user to click for more details)
    Make details button clickable -> onclick it redirects to detailed page 
        The way this needs to work is it goes to the details screen
            but the url needs to be just /details instead of details/2 for example
            because the number would mean that people could go to a url to see details which is not wanted
            I think we can do this through a request.POST 
        
            *It looks like what we need to do is a button with an onclick that creates a post request to a url route

        This might be easier with a django page instead of a react one from scratch
        All information present on page
        also edit button which redirects to another prepopulated page
            I think its better this way because it distinguishes it from the other webapps which is part of the requirements

    Need to make "create bug" page 
    Need to total bug list to homescreen
    Need to reroute homescreen to buglist
