Progress:

    /Need to create admin account (x1 at least)
    /Need to create layout.html page

    /Need to create group for model
    /Need to register all models (admin.site.register) so they show up in the admin console
        /For some reason this didn't work?   
    /Also git is broken
    /Need to extend user model to include group foreign key
        /For all foreign keys in models, get rid of nulls, blanks, and defaults
    /Need to change the title string (Self def)

    /21.01.29 - Left off on rendering bugs page
    /    Need to make a get request to the view that returns JSON with bug list
    /    Need for that to print out something to make sure that view is being hit
    /        From there you can change it so that 


    /Need to list all current bugs on the index page (if logged in)
    /    Gonna need to come up with alternative 
    /Need to replace front-end with react


    20.02.06:

    /Need to add all information about the bug to bug list
    /    title
    /    severity
    /        colors?
    /    type
    /        colors?
    /    (then a small label at the bottom in light gray asking user to click for more details)
    
   / Currently the page is being returned but not rendered, there are a couple ways to deal with this.
   / 1. Change it from button/fetch to href link
   / 2. Change it from post to something else
   /     The guy on discord said to change it to submit???
   / 3. Sink more time into researching why it's not working now.
   / 4. Rewrite it from scratch in Vanilla instead of React
   / 5. Instead of rendering new page, modify react to update page with current details
   /     I think react is supposed to not render new pages so maybe if I want to keep react I have to do this?

    /Currently going to change it to make it into a link 
        On the load of the details page, we can add server side validation to see if the user belongs to the corrent company to view the bug
            but do this later, after you get all other functionality first!


    /Make details button clickable -> onclick it redirects to detailed page 
    /    The way this needs to work is it goes to the details screen
    /        but the url needs to be just /details instead of details/2 for example
    /        because the number would mean that people could go to a url to see details which is not wanted
    /        I think we can do this through a request.POST 
    /    
    /        *It looks like what we need to do is a button with an onclick that creates a post request to a url route

    /    This might be easier with a django page instead of a react one from scratch
    /    All information present on page
    /    also edit button which redirects to another prepopulated page
    /        I think its better this way because it distinguishes it from the other webapps which is part of the requirements

    /Need to finish "edit bug" page 
        /Might actually be better if not done in JS, but rather a simple HTML form
        /Pass the form in and see if that work
            /Need to autopopulate fields
            /Might be able to set field value before passing it into render function
        /Need to create if/else 
        /Need to add way to save

    /Need to make "create bug" page 
    /    Might actually be better if not done in JS, but rather a simple HTML form
    /    Can use a simple for loop to loop through users, etc.

   / Need to total bug list to homescreen
   /     Need to add attribute to store number of total bugs
   /     Need to add fetch to oncreate componnent to grab number
   /     Need to add subdiv to return div in react component so it renders
   /     OR
   /     could create completely new react component and call render function there <-- this is probably the easier way to do it
   /     Also need to add total bug list of which the user is the sme of
   /     Need to add divs in html page upon which this new component can be rendered

    /Need to close bugs
        /Need to add "open" or "active" boolean to data model
        /Set it default to "true"
        /add button on details page to "close"
        /    Needs to call function that calls api url (passes in the id of thebug)
        /    The view will close that bug in the database
        /    Returns generic json "closed: id_of_closed_item"
        /    page redirects to buglist url
        /        Might be able to do this by returning a render instead of json actually
        /Edit the 'usermessagecount' method in views.py to include a filter only for open=true 
        /Edit the 'buglistmessages' method in views.py to include a filter only for open=true 

    /Need to reroute homescreen to buglist
    /Need to add an actual link to createbug url somewhere (it doesn't exist anywhere atm)
    /Need to add alternative url for index if user is not registered
        /probably a page asking the user to log in.
    
    /Need to check which of the below I have actually done...
    /Need to add "categories" filter at top for easy navigation
    /    Optional category: finished bugs

    /    Need to add a new url in layout ONLY for when user is logged in
    /    add url to urls.py
    /    add method to views.py
    /        have it render a NEW html page that you created
    /        attach a new React JS file to this new page
    /        test and run it

    /Need to make a list of pages that the user can get to logged in and not logged in and enforce that

    /Need to check current status of project with all requirements -> checks out

    Need to do read.me
        Start with skeleton of answering requirement questions
        then pad it out to make it nice/easy to read
